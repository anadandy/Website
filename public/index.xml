      <description>For this project, I selected SAT and ACT exam scores in the state of Texas for the class of 2017, organized by school district. I chose this data because as I was scrolling through hundreds of datasets, the same information for California appeared and I decided to do some research and see if Texas had the same information available. Once I found the data, I became very intrigued by how the data differs so greatly over the whole state.</description>

      <description>Ana Dandy amd5355 Introduction: For this project, I found a dataset which has information about teenage birth rates in the United States for every state from 1990-2018. The categorical variable initally had 3 subgroups, 15-17 y/o, 15-19 y/o, and 18-19 y/o; and for this project, I decided to omit the 15-19 y/o entries so that I could have a binary response and so that I can look at the information as two parts rather than a part and a whole.</description>
